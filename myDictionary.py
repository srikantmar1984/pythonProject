"""Dictionary and Tuple"""

# tup1 = "srikant"
# tup2 = ("srikant",)
# print(type(tup1))
# print(type(tup2))

# tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
# print(tuple1)
# count = 0
# for i in tuple1:
#     print("tuple1[%d] = %d"%(count, i))
#     count = count+1


# list1 = ['srikant', 1, 2, 54.30, {'Name: ''Peter'}]
# print(list1)
# tuple1 = ('srikant',5,8,31.9,[1,2,3])
# print(type(tuple1))

#It is the most important difference between list and tuple whereas lists are mutable, and tuples are immutable. The lists are mutable which means the Python object can be modified after creation, whereas tuples can't be modified after creation. Consider the given an example.

# list1[0] = "rupa"
# print(list1)
#
# tuple1[0] = "rupa"
# print(tuple1)
