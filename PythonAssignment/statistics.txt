-> In a factory, the weight of the concrete poured into a mold by a machine follows a normal distribution with a mean of 1150 pounds and a standard deviation of 22 pounds. Approximately 95% of molds filled by this machine will hold weights in what interval? What about 99%?
-> Women’s heights have a mean of 63.6 in. and a standard deviation of 2.5 inches. The z score corresponding to a woman with a height is 2.56. How tall is the woman?
-> The mean temperature in Glens Falls for the month of February is 23 degrees with a standard deviation of 4.2 degrees. What is the z-score for a temperature of 17 degrees?
-> For a Christmas and New Year’s week, the National Safety Council estimated that 500 people would be killed and 25,000 injured on the nation’s roads. The NSC claimed that 50% of the accidents would be caused by drunk driving. A sample of 120 accidents showed that 67 were caused by drunk driving. Use these data to test the NSC’s claim with alpha = .05
-> What pupose does hypothesis testing serves? What is the idea of testing hypthesis using level of significance. How is p-value approach different?
-> The population size is 340. The population exhibits a normal distribution. A sample of size n = 76 was taken; Now the average mean for this sample is 79.9. Std deviation is 5.6. Find the Confidence Interval when Confidence Coefficient is 0.9, 0.95 and 0.99
->  We have a sample distribution of different varities of apples. We pick a random sample from local superstore. The sample mean is Rs. 130 per kg. Std deviation is rs. 14. Let us provide a 90% confidence interval estimate of the mean price per kg for the population. We will assume this population to be normally distributed. Find out the range of error.
